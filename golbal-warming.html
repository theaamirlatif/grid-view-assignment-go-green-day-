                <h1>What is the global warming and climate change</h1>
                <p>Earth is warming up, and humans are at least partially to blame. The causes, effects, and 
                    complexities of global warming are important to understand so that we can fight for the health 
                    of our planet.<br><br>
                    Global warming is the long-term warning of the planet's overall temperature. Though this warming 
                    trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred 
                    years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume 
                    of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes 
                    what is known as the "greenhouse effect" in Earth's atmosphere.<br><br>
                    The greenhouse effect is when the sun's rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is 
                    reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil 
                    fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, 
                    chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere 
                    has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global</p>
